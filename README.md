# hello-world

Hello world! everyone is using GitHub so I thought I would join up and give it a go. I am currently working through freecodecamp.org's responsive web design and hope to be finished this month. I used to develop web pages back in the late 90's. So ya, lots has changed since then and I am excited to be learning all the new technology.
